This file becomes the thesis' design chapter.

## 2026-06-25 — M4: fix mobile PDF download (cross-origin attachment → blob)

- PWA now FETCHES the signed PDF into memory and serves it via a same-origin
  `blob:` URL (download attribute honoured), instead of linking the `<a>`
  straight at the cross-origin OSS URL · navigating to a cross-origin attachment
  silently does nothing on mobile (works on desktop): the `download` attribute is
  ignored cross-origin and the phone swallows the same-tab navigation with NO
  error — the classic "browser quietly refuses and never tells you". A
  same-origin blob URL is the one thing that downloads reliably on desktop AND
  mobile · 2026-06-25
- Force `https://` on OSS_ENDPOINT (in `.env` AND a normaliser in OssStorage) ·
  oss2 signs presigned URLs with the endpoint's scheme; an `http://` endpoint
  produced an http URL that the HTTPS PWA refused to fetch as MIXED CONTENT (a
  browser never lets an HTTPS page load an HTTP resource). The code normaliser is
  belt-and-suspenders so a misconfigured `http://` value can't reintroduce it ·
  2026-06-25
- Added a CORS rule (allowed origin, GET) on the OSS bucket · once the URL was
  HTTPS, OSS answered 200 but the browser blocked JS from READING the response
  (no Access-Control-Allow-Origin) — a `fetch()` to another domain needs that
  domain's explicit permission. Was a non-issue while we merely navigated to the
  URL; it appears precisely because we now fetch it · 2026-06-25
- KEPT the two-tap flow (prepare → download) · not a bug: the second tap is the
  native user gesture mobile needs to save a file (a programmatic click/location
  change after the await is outside the gesture and gets ignored). Robustness, on
  purpose — extends the 06-23 two-tap decision, now also covering the fetch step ·
  2026-06-25

## 2026-06-23 — M4 step 4: PWA wiring (auth + upload + today's list)

- Magic-link auth via the official @supabase/supabase-js SDK (not a hand-rolled
  fetch against /auth/v1/otp+verify) · the SDK handles the PKCE redirect, token
  storage and silent refresh — reimplementing that is more code and more fragile,
  against the "code you fully understand / simple thing that works" TFG rule ·
  2026-06-23
- Browser client uses the new PUBLISHABLE key (sb_publishable_…), not the legacy
  anon key · Supabase's current public client key; exposed as VITE_* (public by
  design — only grants what Auth+RLS allow). Secret key never reaches the bundle ·
  2026-06-23
- Dev cross-origin solved with a Vite proxy (/api → localhost:8000), NOT backend
  CORS · the browser then sees one origin, so zero CORS config and it works
  through the cloudflared tunnel (phone→tunnel→Vite→proxy→backend). Supabase Auth
  calls go direct (Supabase sends its own CORS). DISCARDED adding CORSMiddleware ·
  2026-06-23
- Expose created_at in the API record projection · the Home "today" filter needs
  one date present on EVERY row; prescription_date/treatment_date are null for
  OBSERVATIONs, created_at (DB-generated) is the only universal one. Not a new DB
  field — just lets an existing column out (resolves the 06-19 "deferred date
  filter") · 2026-06-23
- "Today" decided in Europe/Madrid via Intl.DateTimeFormat (not raw UTC date) ·
  CLAUDE.md rule 9 (UTC stored, local rendered); a record at 00:30 Madrid is
  today, not yesterday's UTC day · 2026-06-23
- transaction_id (crypto.randomUUID) + device_timestamp captured ONCE when the
  recording stops and reused on retry · hard rules 2+3: the device clock is the
  treatment date, and a stable idempotency key means a network-error retry hits
  the existing row instead of duplicating a legal record · 2026-06-23
- Recording auto-uploads on an explicit "Enviar" tap, not on stop · the POST is
  synchronous and slow (Qwen); the advisor reviews/replays the take first and a
  failed upload retries the SAME take · 2026-06-23
- TodayList fetches inline in the effect with an `active` guard + a refetch via
  refreshKey/attempt counters (not a useCallback) · react-hooks 7's
  set-state-in-effect rule can't see the await across a useCallback boundary;
  inline keeps every setState provably post-await · 2026-06-23
- PDF opened via a NEW endpoint GET /api/interventions/{id}/pdf that signs the
  OSS URL on demand, not a URL embedded per list row · realises the list's
  stated "sign on demand" design (one signing call only when tapped, not N per
  list); new repo method get_intervention(id, advisor_id) where the advisor
  scope IS the authorization (another advisor's id → indistinguishable 404) ·
  2026-06-23
- Record without a PDF (OBSERVATION, or failed render) → 404 PDF_NOT_FOUND, same
  as a missing record · there is no document to return; endpoint raises no
  domain errors, reusing the app-level handlers (repo crash → catch-all 500, OSS
  signing failure → InfrastructureError 503), consistent with the other routes ·
  2026-06-23
- PWA DOWNLOADS the signed PDF in TWO taps: tap 1 signs the URL (async), tap 2
  is a real <a> the user clicks · inline/new-tab lost to the browser's "download
  PDFs" setting and mobile blank tabs; and a programmatic click / location change
  AFTER the await is outside the user gesture, so mobile Chrome ignored it. A
  genuine tap on a ready same-tab <a> (OSS attachment → downloads in place) is the
  one thing that works on desktop AND mobile · 2026-06-23
- presigned_url signs response-content-disposition=attachment;filename · forces
  the download with a sensible name on every device. NOT response-content-type:
  the object already stores Content-Type application/pdf (set at upload) and OSS
  rejects overriding it ("can not override response header on content type") ·
  2026-06-23
- New Storage.exists (HEAD via oss2 object_exists), checked before signing the
  PDF link · a DB key can outlive its object (other bucket / deleted), and a
  signed URL to a missing object shows OSS's raw NoSuchKey XML in the browser;
  the HEAD turns it into a clean 404 PDF_NOT_FOUND · 2026-06-23

## 2026-06-22 — M4 step 1: installable PWA scaffold (Vite + React + Tailwind)

- Stack = Vite + React (JavaScript, not TypeScript) + Tailwind v4 + vite-plugin-pwa
  · React has the most AI/tutorial/StackOverflow support (decisive for a frontend
  beginner) and is the most defensible for a TFG; plain JS over TS to remove a
  layer of complexity (backend already gives type rigor via Pydantic) · 2026-06-22
- Tailwind ALONE, no Bootstrap (tutor suggested combining) · Tailwind already
  covers the responsive need Bootstrap is known for, via sm:/md:/lg: breakpoints;
  loading both = two competing CSS systems (conflicting resets, extra weight,
  harder to understand — against the "code you fully understand" TFG rule). Pick
  one · 2026-06-22
- DISCARDED packaging as a native app (tutor's "native PWA" = TWA/Capacitor for
  the Play Store) · the installable PWA already gives install + offline; store
  packaging is post-MVP and only if store distribution is needed · 2026-06-22
- Safe-area handling from the START (tutor's strongest point: device margins
  differ per phone) · viewport-fit=cover in index.html + env(safe-area-inset-*)
  exposed as reusable @utility classes (pt-safe/pb-safe/p-safe); every future
  screen opts in with one class. Two-layer layout (safe padding on outer,
  design padding on inner) so they don't override each other · 2026-06-22
- min-h-dvh over min-h-screen (100vh) · 100vh miscalculates on mobile (browser
  chrome shows/hides); dvh tracks the real visible height · 2026-06-22
- HTTPS on the phone via a cloudflared quick tunnel (not Vite basic-ssl, not the
  Chrome insecure-origin flag) · service worker AND getUserMedia need a secure
  context; the tunnel gives a real trusted cert (no warnings), works off-Wi-Fi,
  and unblocks both real WebAPK install and the M4-step-2 microphone. Over plain
  LAN HTTP Chrome only offered a shortcut, not a true install · 2026-06-22
- server.allowedHosts=true in vite.config · the tunnel forwards a *.trycloudflare.com
  Host that changes each run and Vite's DNS-rebinding guard would block it; safe
  as this is the dev server only · the tunnel is ephemeral (killed = private again) · 2026-06-22

## 2026-06-19 — CI green: lazy OSS bucket (surfaced by GitHub Actions)

- OssStorage builds its oss2.Bucket lazily (_get_bucket on first use), not in
  __init__ · the Bucket constructor validates the endpoint, so eager
  construction made merely IMPORTING the app require a live OSS config; an empty
  OSS_ENDPOINT (CI, no .env) crashed at collection. Now mirrors the Supabase
  adapter's lazy client; imports/tests that mock storage need no OSS config ·
  2026-06-19
- GitHub Actions: pytest on push/PR via uv (uv sync --frozen); only the 4
  no-default settings get dummy env values (telegram/supabase_url/
  supabase_service_key/dashscope) — unit tests use fakes, never real services ·
  2026-06-19

## 2026-06-19 — Test audit + suite standardization

- Test style migrated from one monolithic main()+prints per file to one
  function per case (pytest-native) · granular pass/fail reporting and failures
  no longer hide the cases after them; standard idiom is more defensible for the
  TFG · 2026-06-19
- Adopt pytest.raises / parametrize / monkeypatch + a TestClient fixture · the
  idiomatic tools now that pytest is the committed runner · 2026-06-19
- No pytest-asyncio dependency · async bodies run via asyncio.run() inside sync
  test functions; keeps the dev deps lean · 2026-06-19
- pyproject [tool.pytest.ini_options] pythonpath=["."] · removes the per-file
  sys.path hack; tests run only via `uv run pytest` (dropped the __main__
  script-runners) · 2026-06-19
- New coverage: validation_service, states, schemas (trust boundary), auth (M4),
  api inbound (error→HTTP mapping). DELIBERATELY NOT covered: the thin SDK
  adapters (qwen/oss/reportlab/telegram, supabase_repo body) — testing them is
  mocking the SDK, low ROI; supabase_repo already has the serialize guard ·
  2026-06-19
- Audit found no behavioural bugs · confirmed dose/area limits are inclusive
  (rule is >, not >=), error→HTTP mapping (404/422/503/500/401) and the catch-all
  all behave as intended · 2026-06-19

## 2026-06-19 — M4 step 3: list endpoint + API safety net

- GET /api/interventions scoped to the authenticated advisor (same
  current_advisor_id dependency), optional ?state= filter (enum-validated by
  FastAPI → bad value is an automatic 422), newest first, limit 100 · spec §7 ·
  2026-06-19
- List uses a sync _record_fields projection (no presigned URL per row — N OSS
  calls would not scale); carries has_pdf, the detail view signs on demand. The
  create response = _record_fields + a single presigned pdf_url · 2026-06-19
- "del día" date filter deferred to Home wiring · "today" is timezone-dependent
  (Madrid vs UTC) and which timestamp to use is a UX call; decide it with the
  real screen, not blind · 2026-06-19
- App-level catch-all exception handler (Exception → 500 in {"error","mensaje"})
  added · the HTTP routes had no safety net (unlike the Telegram webhook), so a
  raw Supabase/PostgREST failure in the auth advisor-lookup OR the pipeline
  leaked as a bare 500. More specific handlers still win (dispatch by type) ·
  2026-06-19
- DISCARDED (for now) translating repository errors into InfrastructureError at
  the adapter boundary (the "correct" per errors.py) · touches every repo method;
  the catch-all covers it cheaply for M4. Revisit when the repo grows · 2026-06-19

## 2026-06-19 — M4 step 2: Supabase JWT auth (JWKS, ES256)

- Verify the access token against the asymmetric signing keys via the JWKS
  endpoint (derived from supabase_url), NOT the legacy HS256 shared secret ·
  CLAUDE.md mandate; asymmetric verification needs only public keys, so no new
  secret in .env · 2026-06-19
- Backend verifies the JWT itself + uses service_role for DB (bypasses RLS) ·
  the PWA talks to FastAPI, not to Supabase directly, so identity is enforced in
  the backend; the migration's RLS is a second layer, not this path · 2026-06-19
- advisor resolved by advisors.auth_user_id = token ``sub`` · a valid token whose
  user is not an advisor → 401 (authenticated ≠ authorized) · 2026-06-19
- Verification lives in its own inbound module app/adapters/inbound/auth.py (not
  api.py, unlike the error handlers) · ~50 lines, self-contained, reused by
  future routes — extraction earns its cost here · 2026-06-19
- AuthError → 401 via its own exception_handler, same {"error","mensaje"} shape ·
  auth is an HTTP-boundary concern, kept out of core domain errors · 2026-06-19
- HTTPBearer(auto_error=False) · a missing header becomes our AuthError 401, not
  FastAPI's default 403, so every auth failure shares one shape · 2026-06-19
- JWKS fetch + jwt.decode run via asyncio.to_thread · blocking I/O kept off the
  event loop; PyJWKClient caches keys, refetch only on unknown kid · 2026-06-19
- Library: PyJWT[crypto] (cryptography backs ES256) · 2026-06-19

## 2026-06-18 — M4 step 1: PWA inbound endpoint (POST /api/records)

- Second inbound route over the SAME pipeline · hexagonal: Telegram and the PWA
  are two inbound adapters on one core, no business-logic change (as api.py
  already anticipated) · 2026-06-18
- Synchronous (no background task, unlike Telegram) · the PWA UI waits for the
  outcome to show (saved record or 422 dose/area error); Telegram backgrounds
  only because it ACKs to avoid webhook-retry timeouts · 2026-06-18
- Error translation via app-level `exception_handler` (not try/except per route)
  · one policy shared by all HTTP routes; *_NOT_FOUND→404, other DomainError→422,
  InfrastructureError→503 as {"error","mensaje"} (spec §7) · 2026-06-18
- Handlers kept in api.py, NOT a separate error_handlers.py · only two + small,
  and error→HTTP translation is the inbound adapter's own job; extract via
  register_error_handlers(app) when it grows (>250 lines / more handlers) ·
  2026-06-18
- Auth deferred to M4 step 2 · reuse the default_advisor_id stand-in so the
  endpoint is curl-testable now; JWKS JWT verification lands next · 2026-06-18
- GPS left out of the request · pipeline.register doesn't take it and AEMET is
  M5; a silently-dropped gps field would mislead. Add it with AEMET · 2026-06-18
- Response is a focused JSON projection, not the raw Intervention · internal
  traceability fields (raw_transcription, prompt_version, storage keys) stay out
  of the API; best-effort presigned pdf_url like the Telegram summary · 2026-06-18

## 2026-06-18 — Review feedback: robust save + error catch-all

- `_serialize` filters to real columns explicitly (skips DB-generated +
  fields tagged `metadata={"persist": False}`) instead of dumping the whole
  dataclass · a model field that is not a column would otherwise blow up the
  INSERT with an opaque PostgREST error, hard to trace · 2026-06-18
- New `tests/test_serialize_columns.py` parses the migration and asserts the
  insert payload == real columns (minus generated) · detects model<->schema
  drift in both directions at test time, no DB/credentials needed · 2026-06-18
- Catch-all `except Exception` + `logger.exception` added to `_handle_update`
  (Telegram background task) · an unhandled error in a BackgroundTask dies
  silently and leaves the advisor stuck on "procesando…"; the log trace is
  how you see *why* it failed · 2026-06-18
- DISCARDED a global FastAPI `@app.exception_handler` for now · it only fires
  in the request→response cycle, but the Telegram work runs in a
  BackgroundTask after the ACK; the right home for it is the synchronous PWA
  HTTP path (M4), not built ahead of need · 2026-06-18
- DISCARDED translating `httpx` errors in `download_voice` to
  `InfrastructureError` · the catch-all already handles them; per-adapter
  translation buys nothing today (Qwen/OSS already translate at their
  boundary, Supabase/Telegram fall through to the catch-all) · 2026-06-18
- Telegram `transaction_id` derived as `uuid5(ns, update_id)` instead of a
  fresh `uuid4()` per webhook call · Telegram redelivers the same `update_id`
  on retry, so a per-call uuid4 defeated hard rule 3 (idempotency) → duplicate
  records of one audio. Deterministic key makes a redelivery hit the existing
  row. PWA (M4) sends its own `crypto.randomUUID()` · 2026-06-18
- Split `_handle_update` into router + `_process_message` · the catch-all
  only covered the inner `try`, so update parsing before it (a `KeyError` on
  `message["from"]`/`["date"]`, the early notifier sends) could still die
  silently in the BackgroundTask. Now chat_id extraction is the only thing
  outside the net (guarded: no sender → log + drop, nobody to reply to) and
  ALL processing sits under one error policy · 2026-06-18
- `_summary` PDF-link block widened to `except InfrastructureError` +
  `except Exception` · building the presigned link must NEVER turn an
  already-saved record into an error message to the advisor · 2026-06-18
- `_store_prescription_pdf` now catches `Exception`, not just `StorageError` ·
  a ReportLab render bug sat inside the try and ran BEFORE save_intervention,
  so it blocked the legal record — contradicting the stated best-effort
  intent. Now any render/upload failure logs + saves without a PDF key · 2026-06-18
- `TelegramNotifier.send_message` adds `raise_for_status` + `except
  httpx.HTTPError` -> log warning, never raise · notifications are
  best-effort: a failed send must not break the flow nor make a saved record
  look failed (it silently swallowed HTTP errors before) · 2026-06-18
- Adopted `pytest` as a dev dependency (`uv run pytest` runs all) · reverses
  the earlier "no pytest yet" note: it was written with a single test, now
  there are 3 and running them one by one is friction. Only the *runner*
  changes — still few tests, no exhaustive suite. Files keep their
  `if __name__` block so they also run standalone · 2026-06-18

## 2026-06-17 — M3 step 2: PDF upload to OSS (FLUJO A, PRESCRIPTION)

- New async `Storage` port + `OssStorage` adapter (oss2) · uploading is network
  I/O, so the port is async (mirror of PdfGenerator being sync CPU); the port
  takes/returns bytes and never knows it is a PDF · 2026-06-17
- `oss2` is a synchronous SDK → every network call wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread`
  to keep the event loop free; OSS errors translated to `StorageError` at the
  adapter boundary (provider-swap safe) · 2026-06-17
- OSS key = `prescriptions/{transaction_id}.pdf` · transaction_id is known
  BEFORE the INSERT, so the key is set on the entity and persisted in a single DB
  write (no separate update method); deterministic key → a retry overwrites the
  same object, consistent with idempotency · 2026-06-17
- PDF+upload is BEST-EFFORT in the pipeline: on `StorageError` (or missing
  holding) save the intervention with `prescription_pdf_key=None` · a storage
  failure must never block the legal record (same principle as rule 8/AEMET); the
  PDF is deterministic and regenerable from the row · 2026-06-17
- Only the PRESCRIPTION branch generates the PDF (per spec FLUJO A) · a direct
  EXECUTION's document is the CUE execution record (M5/M6), not a prescription · 2026-06-17
- Added `Repository.get_holding` · the PDF needs the holding (owner/NIF/REA) and
  the pipeline only had `plot.holding_id`; fetched lazily inside the PDF step so
  OBSERVATION/EXECUTION don't pay the extra query · 2026-06-17
- Private bucket: the advisor gets a presigned GET URL (1h expiry) appended to the
  Telegram confirmation, not a public object URL · legal documents; chose the
  link over `sendDocument` to avoid widening the Notifier port in M3 · 2026-06-17
- Pipeline now depends on the `PdfGenerator` + `Storage` ports (injected via the
  container) · keeps the core pure and the wiring a one-line composition-root
  change · 2026-06-17

## 2026-06-16 — M3 step 1: prescription PDF (ReportLab, no OSS yet)

- Built the PDF generation first (port + ReportLab adapter), writing to disk,
  before touching OSS · lets us validate the legal template fast without an
  Alibaba bucket; OSS upload is step 2 · 2026-06-16
- `PdfGenerator.generate_prescription` is SYNCHRONOUS, not async · building a PDF
  is pure CPU (no I/O); async callers wrap it in asyncio.to_thread. The Storage
  port (OSS) will be the async/I/O one · 2026-06-16
- `generate_prescription` takes the domain entities (intervention, advisor,
  holding, plot, product, equipment) directly, not a new DTO · simpler and
  matches what the pipeline already resolves; a DTO would be abstraction ahead
  of need · 2026-06-16
- ReportLab via platypus (SimpleDocTemplate + Tables) instead of low-level
  canvas · the document is a label/value form, tables handle layout/wrapping
  for free · 2026-06-16
- Timestamps rendered in Europe/Madrid via zoneinfo (hard rule 9); naive
  datetimes treated as UTC · 2026-06-16
- Sample generator lives in tests/ and writes sample_prescription.pdf (gitignored)
  for visual review · not a real assertion suite, just an eyeball artifact · 2026-06-16

## 2026-06-16 — M2: fuzzy name resolution (ASR mis-hears proper nouns)

- The ASR mis-transcribes proper nouns ("Abamectina"→"amavectina", "Finca de
  Pepe"→"Finca de PP"), so exact `ilike` lookups failed · resolve dictated names
  by fuzzy-matching against the catalog instead of exact match · 2026-06-16
- Chose fuzzy-match-against-the-catalog over feeding domain vocabulary to the
  ASR · the MAPA vademecum is thousands of products — too many for ASR context,
  and a huge context degrades transcription; fuzzy matching scales and only ever
  resolves to a REAL row (never invents a value, hard rule 4) · 2026-06-16
- Rejected fuzzy-matching over free text · matching only against catalog rows +
  a similarity threshold + an ambiguity guard (refuse when the top two are
  equally close) keeps it legally safe; below threshold → None → the service
  tells the advisor, it never guesses · 2026-06-16
- Doses/quantities are NEVER fuzzy-matched, only identity (plot/product/
  equipment) · dose is an exact legal value; `raw_transcription` keeps what was
  actually heard for audit alongside the resolved row · 2026-06-16
- M2 matches in Python (`difflib`, stdlib — no new dependency) over small row
  sets; logged that product matching must move to a pg_trgm similarity query
  (DB-side, GIN trigram index) once the real vademecum is loaded · 2026-06-16
- Fuzzy helpers live in a pure module `adapters/outbound/_fuzzy.py` (no settings
  import) · unit-testable without env/DB · 2026-06-16
- Deferred confirm-before-persist + manual field correction to M5/M4 · the
  confirmation flow needs conversational state (callback handlers, draft store)
  and "execution confirmation" is M5 scope; the fuzzy threshold + the bot's
  echo-back summary + correctable records (M5: correction = new intervention +
  soft-delete) are enough safety for M2 · 2026-06-16

## 2026-06-15 — M2: registration pipeline (FLUJO A) wired end-to-end

- FastAPI is THE inbound; the Telegram webhook is one thin route over the core
  pipeline, the future PWA (M4) will be a second route on the SAME pipeline ·
  Telegram is a stand-in client until the PWA exists; hexagonal lets us swap the
  transport without touching business logic · 2026-06-15
- The pipeline does NOT depend on the Notifier port (it raises/returns) ·
  how to answer is transport specific (Telegram message vs HTTP 422 JSON), so
  notification stays in the inbound adapter; keeps the core fully pure · 2026-06-15
- M2 Telegram stand-in compromises (revisit at M4): `advisor_id` from a single
  `DEFAULT_ADVISOR_ID` setting, `transaction_id` minted server-side (PWA will
  send crypto.randomUUID()), `device_timestamp` = Telegram message date ·
  Telegram carries no auth/UUID/device clock; documented debt, not a design · 2026-06-15
- `prompt_version` added to the Extractor port (read-only property) · the legal
  trace (interventions.prompt_version) must hold for any extractor, so it is part
  of the contract, not a Qwen detail · 2026-06-15
- Generic `_serialize`/`_deserialize` helpers in the Supabase adapter (coerce by
  dataclass type hints) instead of a hand-written mapper per entity · less code
  for a student to read and one place to fix coercion bugs · 2026-06-15
- Audio sent to Qwen as a base64 data URI instead of a temp file · avoids
  touching the filesystem on the server; the M1 temp-file path was spike-only · 2026-06-15
- supabase_repo uses the service_role key (bypasses RLS) · M2 backend is trusted
  and the Telegram stand-in has no Supabase Auth JWT; the migration's RLS still
  guards the PWA path · 2026-06-15
- Dropped `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` from config · no JWT to verify until the PWA
  authenticates (M4), and the legacy shared HS256 secret is deprecated by
  Supabase; verify via the asymmetric signing keys / JWKS endpoint when M4 needs
  it · 2026-06-16

## 2026-06-12 — M1 → M2: hexagonal skeleton

- Created the M2 hexagonal skeleton (`core/{domain,ports,services}`,
  `adapters/{inbound,outbound}`, `config/`, `prompts/`, `spike/`); only folders +
  `__init__.py`, no speculative modules · honors "create folders from M2, implement
  ports/adapters on demand" · 2026-06-12
- Renamed `app/config.py` → `config/settings.py` · matches the documented layout
  and avoids confusing "config the module" with "config the package" · 2026-06-12
- `app/db.py` → `adapters/outbound/supabase_repo.py` · it is the DB outbound adapter · 2026-06-12
- `app/telegram.py` → `adapters/outbound/telegram.py` · classified as outbound (it is
  a Telegram API client: send messages, download voice files) · 2026-06-12
- `app/qwen.py` kept as a single `adapters/outbound/qwen.py` instead of splitting into
  `qwen_audio.py` + `qwen_instruct.py` (per layout) · they share the DashScope client
  setup and the split adds no value until the M2 transcriber/extractor ports exist —
  defer to M2 · 2026-06-12
- `app/main.py` → `spike/main.py` · current FastAPI + Telegram-webhook glue is M1
  throwaway orchestration; M2 will introduce the real `adapters/inbound/api.py` · 2026-06-12
- `Settings.env_file` now points at `config/.env` (was `.env`) · the env file lives next
  to `settings.py`; resolved relative to the project root (CWD) · 2026-06-12
- `.gitignore`: un-ignored `.env.example` (the `.env.*` rule was also hiding the
  template) so the committed example stays tracked · 2026-06-12
- Wrapped the code packages under a single top-level `app/` package
  (`app/core`, `app/adapters`, `app/config`); `spike/`, `prompts/`, `docs/` stay at
  the root · keeps generic names (`config`, `core`) out of the top-level import
  namespace and avoids clashes; diverges from the original flat spec layout (updated
  in CLAUDE.md) · imports become `app.<...>`; `env_file` → `app/config/.env` · 2026-06-12
- Kept empty `__init__.py` in every package folder · they declare real (non-namespace)
  packages so imports, pytest and mypy behave predictably · 2026-06-12

## 2026-06-12 — M2: domain layer (core/domain)

- Implemented the four domain modules from spec §5 (`errors.py`, `states.py`,
  `schemas.py`, `models.py`) · they are M2's foundation: everything else
  (ports, services, repo) depends on them · 2026-06-12
- `LifecycleState` as `StrEnum` instead of the spec's plain strings ·
  `LifecycleState.PRESCRIBED == 'PRESCRIBED'` keeps DB writes identical while
  preventing typos and giving IDE autocompletion; spec is a map, not a
  contract · 2026-06-12
- Added `DomainError`/`InfrastructureError` base classes with a `code` class
  attribute per domain error · M2's `api.py` needs ONE exception handler
  mapping `code` → `{"error": ..., "mensaje": ...}` instead of seven; codes
  reuse the `audit_state` vocabulary where it exists · 2026-06-12
- DB `DECIMAL` columns typed as `float` in dataclasses (not `Decimal`) · the
  Supabase JSON API returns floats anyway and the legal comparisons
  (dose ≤ max, area ≤ enclosure) don't need exact decimal arithmetic at this
  scale; matches `ExtractedFields` (spec uses `float`) · 2026-06-12
- Dataclasses mirror the FULL migration schema (including M5+ blocks like
  weather/effectiveness) even though M2 only persists the basics · the
  migration already created those columns, so this mirrors existing DB, it is
  not speculative; `id`/`created_at`/`updated_at` default to None (DB
  generates them) · 2026-06-12
- `Optional[X]` written as `X | None` throughout · consistency with the
  existing codebase (qwen.py) over the spec's `Optional[...]` style;
  functionally identical in Pydantic V2 · 2026-06-12
- No tests for the domain yet · CLAUDE.md scopes tests to prompt edge cases;
  the state machine was smoke-tested manually (all legal + illegal
  transitions) · 2026-06-12
- Renamed infrastructure errors from vendor names (`QwenError`, `AemetError`,
  `OssError`) to port names (`TranscriptionError`, `ExtractionError`,
  `WeatherError`, `StorageError`) · the core catches errors through the ports,
  so a provider swap (Qwen→Whisper, AEMET→other) must not touch the domain;
  adapters translate vendor errors at the boundary. Four errors instead of
  three because Qwen spans two ports (transcriber + extractor) · 2026-06-12

## 2026-06-12 — M2: ports (core/ports)

- Created the four ports M2's audio flow needs as async ABCs: `Transcriber`
  (bytes→text), `Extractor` (text→ExtractedFields), `Repository` (Supabase
  lookups + insert), `Notifier` (message back to the advisor) · "ABCs added
  on demand": storage/weather/pdf_generator wait for M3/M5 · 2026-06-12
- New port `notifier.py`, not in the original spec layout (added to CLAUDE.md
  and spec) · the pipeline runs as a background task (the webhook ACKs
  immediately), so the core must push results/errors to the advisor; named
  by function, not "telegram" — in M4+ the channel may become PWA push ·
  2026-06-12
- Downloading the Telegram voice file is NOT a port · fetching the audio is
  the inbound adapter's job; the core receives bytes (it never asks
  "download file_id X") · 2026-06-12
- Repository lookups return `None` instead of raising · which domain error a
  miss becomes (PlotNotFoundError vs ProductError...) is a business decision
  that belongs to the service, not to the persistence adapter · 2026-06-12
- ExtractedFields validation declared part of the Extractor port's contract ·
  hard rule 4 (LLM output is untrusted) must hold for ANY future extractor
  implementation, not just Qwen's · 2026-06-12
- One `Repository` ABC (not one per entity) with only FLUJO A's six methods ·
  a single port matches the spec layout and the single Supabase adapter;
  splitting per entity is abstraction ahead of need · 2026-06-12
